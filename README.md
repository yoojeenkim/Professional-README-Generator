# Professional README Generator



## Description
As a developer, I wanted to generate professional READMEs without having to go through the hassle of writing out the template every time. Also, Paul said it is good practice to write READMEs and I don't want to be scolded by Paul. Provided is a link to a video demonstrating the use of this README generator.
